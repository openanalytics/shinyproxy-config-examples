# Example: standalone ShinyProxy with Docker

This example represents the most straightforward setup: you run ShinyProxy as a standalone Java process. ShinyProxy accesses a docker engine to spawn containers running the user's Shiny apps.

There is no clustering involved here: everything runs on a single host, or maybe two hosts if you have your Java runtime and docker engine on separate machines.

## Requirement

ShinyProxy expects relevant Docker images to be already available on the host. Before running this example, pull the Docker image used in this example with:

```bash
sudo docker pull openanalytics/shinyproxy-demo
```

## How to run

1. Download [ShinyProxy](https://www.shinyproxy.io/downloads "ShinyProxy website")
2. Download the `application.yml` configuration file from the folder where this README is located.
3. Place the jar and yaml files in the same directory, e.g. `/home/user/sp`
4. Open a terminal, go to the directory `/home/user/sp`, and run the following command:

`java -jar shinyproxy.jar`

## Notes on the configuration

- ShinyProxy will listen for HTTP traffic on port `8080`.
- ShinyProxy connects to the Docker daemon using a Unix socket, make sure the
  user running ShinyProxy has permission
  to [use this socket](https://shinyproxy.io/documentation/getting-started/#access-to-docker-daemon).
